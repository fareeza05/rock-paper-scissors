# Rock, Paper, Scissors 
---

## About
---
Simple game of rock, paper, scissors where user can choose and their choice is compared against the computer's randomized choice to evaluate who has won the game. Points are then added to either the user, or the machine accordingly and points are kept track of on a scoreboard until and unless user refreshes the page (which resets the whole game).

Made as a learning project for The Odin Project's course.

Live Website :
